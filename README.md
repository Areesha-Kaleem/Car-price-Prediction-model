# Car-price-Prediction-model

ðŸ”¹ Objective: Predicting car selling prices based on features like fuel type, transmission type, selling type, and driven kilometers.

ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing: Implemented one-hot encoding for categorical variables to convert them into a numeric format suitable for machine learning models.

ðŸ”¹ Model Training: Constructed a robust pipeline using scikit-learn's Pipeline and ColumnTransformer to preprocess data and train a LinearRegression model.

ðŸ”¹ Evaluation: Assessed model accuracy by comparing predicted and actual selling prices.
